A friendly explanation of the SDMX Model

## Subfolders

### information_model
Descriptions of SDMX artefacts taken from the official SDMX Information Model document published by the working group can be found here. Wherever possible, the exact descriptions and links have been used. However, some have been altered for clarity (and to correct perceived errors in the source document) and inevitably some mistakes will have been made.

Treat this subfolder as an easier-to-navigate version of the Information Model, but use the model document itself as the source of truth.

Artefacts have been split into subfolders by the chapters of the Information Model document.

### explanations
Friendly explanations of SDMX artefacts can be found here. These, like those in the *information_model* subfolder, have been split into subfolders by the chapters of the Information Model in which they fall.
